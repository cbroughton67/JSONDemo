# JSONDemo
Demo app where I experiment and learn about reading, writing, and modifying the contents of a JSON file. 

*	Serialize a simple List<string> to JSON
*	Deserialize a simple JSON file to List<string>
*	Serialize a List<Person> based on a Person object with three Properties to JSON
*	Deserialize JSON to a List<Person> 

I'll keep adding more scenarios as I think of them to help further my understanding. More to come...
